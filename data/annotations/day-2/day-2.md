The Data Scientist use the cientific method to create a resolution to a problem.
So, what a Data Scientist do?

Scientific Method:

- Observation
- Question
- Hypothesis
- Experiment
- Conclusion

The answer is not important than the question.
The definition of question is the most important.

By asking the right question, you can solve the problem
You need to understand the business

Methodologies:

- Probability
- Testing
- etc...

Data Analysis is a dynamic, not a static, approach to solving problems.
The principle: of using the scientific method remains the same.

It all starts by asking the right question.

Machine Learning IA

Is a ability of algorithms to learn from data, and improve
their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

It is an approach to making decisions:

- The machine identifies patterns in the data, it learns and when a similar situation occurs, it knows how to react.

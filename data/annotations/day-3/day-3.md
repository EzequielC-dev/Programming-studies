# Target Case:

What pregnant woman buy?

- Finding the pattern is the important
- Buy patterns

This case was so accertive, that make the Target knows a girl is pregnant before her father.
The result (incremental revenue): $ 23 billions

- Fraldas (not a recommended datapoint, because usually womans buy when it's close to born)
- Clothes for pregnant woman (not a recommended datapoint)

# Metrics and KPIs

KPI: Measurable values that show how effective something is in achieving goals.
Metrics: Indicators of results that may or may not be essential for a company's growth.

Difference:
KPI: fundamental to performance (huge impact)
Metric: more informative
Key Metric: slightly more important than a regular metric

- Case of Nerdy Nuts:

Exercises:
1- Quantidade de produção por semana, e aumento de vendas por semana
2- Tentar inserir em locais além dos farmers markets.
3- Quantidade de clientes que compram de novo, público que mais compra (jovens, pessoas de meia idade, idosos), sabores mais vendidos de acordo com cada público
4- Depende do preço de produção e do lucro deles, se está satisfatório.

Exercises:
1- Weekly production volume and weekly sales growth
2-Try to expand beyond farmers markets
3- Track customer retention, identify the audience that buys the most (young adults, middle-aged people, seniors), and the most popular flavors by audience segment
4- Analyze production costs and profit margins to determine if they are satisfactory

One interesting thing to do, is to analyse and try to create more metrics
Apparently, there is only two metrics being tracked (total of sales, and the price of a Nerdy Nut pot)

But even with just these two metrics, we can generate many more insights.
For example:
Number of units sold = total sales / price per pot
